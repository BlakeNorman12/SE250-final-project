This website was made to allow users to order pizza over the internet.
The main functionalities were being able to place an order, submit the order to the database
for the restaurant to view, as well as submit a review of the users experience with the website.

This is a very low-level website, mainly assigned for the purpose of breaking into HTML and CSS.
PHP and MySQL were also used with AMPPS development.
